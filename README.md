## Using the Package

Place the file [```soccerbars.sty```](soccerbars.sty) in a directory where LaTeX can find it, and ```\usepackage{soccerbars}``` in the preamble of a document. The first ```\soccerbar{(2-0)}``` looks like an easy win, but turns into a loss ```\soccerbar{(2-0),(2-0)*}``` away. The rest is details and explained in the package documentation ([pdf](doc/soccerbars.pdf)).

This package can be used freely under [*The LaTeX Public Project License*](LICENSE.md).
Additional [implementations for python and R](https://github.com/snlab-eakbiyik/soccerbars) are provided by Eren Akbiyik.
