## Using the Package

Place the file [```soccerbars.sty```](soccerbars.sty) in a directory where LaTeX can find it, and ```\usepackage{soccerbars}``` in the preamble of a document. With ```\soccerbar{(2-1)}``` you can score your first win; away matches may be more challenging, ```\soccerbar{(2-1),(1-1)*}```. The rest is details and explained in the [package documentation](doc/soccerbars.pdf) (pdf).

This package is distributed for free under *The LaTeX Public Project License*.

There are also [packages for python and R](https://github.com/snlab-eakbiyik/soccerbars) implemented by Eren Akbiyik.
